<h4>The Study</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
Our project explores sentiments of public safety in New York City’s Subway system. This research emerges from the heightened reporting around high-profile random acts of violence at the tail end of 2024. Despite historic reductions in transit crime (NYPD, 2025) and the low statistical probability (about (Chalfin et al., 2024)) of falling victim to a crime in the Subway, fear mongering has bolstered the feeling of unsafety underground justifying the resurgence of broken windows policing. According to MTA’s Fall 2024 Customers Count survey, 56% of customers indicated they felt safe on trains, an increase from 45% in the spring. Regardless of the data, the new year and tailwind of news headlines from 2024 presented an opportunity for the mayoral office and NYPD to crack down on crime, directing over 200 officers underground, in addition to the 2,600 cops already stationed in the Subway (Lane, 2025) and 1,000 National Guard officers (Heyward, 2024), “to do speciality train patrols” as “part of a strategy to refocus our Subway efforts to the places where crime is occurring” (Tisch, 2025). <br> <br>
<i>If</i>: “The Subways will be a bellwether for the perception of public safety in New York City” (Tisch, 2025), the statistical data in crime reporting alone cannot explain the atmosphere of un/safety, nor do they validate the responses in policy programming and the weaponization of carceral tactics. <br> <br>

*Given Police Commissioner Tisch’s insistence on a data-driven approach to policing, we are interested in transit crime and ridership data over a 3-year period and how these are interpreted and communicated through policy-making and news outlets to inform and govern public space and sentiment. Our research thus asks, <i> what are the real causes of the perception of fear and how do they accommodate for the militarization of NYC’s Subway system? </i> Analyzing news reports, crime data, and public policy from 2022 to the present allows us to gain a better understanding of un/safety, notions of public space, and the pathologization of criminality in the Subway system.  <br> <br>
</p>

<h4>Public Order... For Whom?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
Public transit has been understudied in urban planning and design, invisibilized underground as public infrastructure left to the attention of engineers and economists (Tuvikene et al., 2023). However, as North America’s largest transportation network with over 3 million riders daily (MTA, n.d.), embracing the MTA Subway system as infrastructure and public space opens up opportunities to explore the social significance of spaces – “what is, can be, or should be public in the city” (Tuvikene et al., 2023:2964). While public space “is as much present as always in becoming in (contested) processes” (Iveson, 2007 in Tuvikene et al., 2023), the carceral control of underground terrain raises questions over who has the right to the city (Harvey, 2019)? More specifically, who has the right to “claim some kind of shaping power over processes of urbanization” (ibid.,:5), the extent of a space’s publicness, why it matters, and for whom? <br> <br>
Drawing on a longer history regarding the role of the police in relation to the public considering recent momentum to securitize the public space of the transit system through carceral techniques. In the 1990s, patrolling public (dis)order occupied the central agenda of the NYPD where untended property became the site of securitization under the broken windows theory (Manguel, 2025). Conceived of by Kelling and Wilson (1982) and popularized by then Mayor Rudy Giuliani, broken windows theory punishes low-level “crime” suggesting that “untended behaviour” would lead to rising, especially violent, crime. Policing dis/order thus became the logical response to quell perceptions of rising threat while justifying the diversion of public resources into the department as the means and ends to maintain public order, effectively criminalizing poor, working-class, racialized communities. This is of particular concern today with the crackdown on low-level quality-of-life “crimes” (aggressive panhandling, smoking or drinking alcohol in the Subway, lying on Subway seats, fare evasion) (Lane, 2025). Broken windows theory works hand-in-hand with deterrence theory where increased police presence is posited to increase perceptions of risk and apprehension, thus deterring disorder, danger, and crime (Roberts et al., 2024). The effects of deterrence theory have been critiqued (ibid.), conflating increased arrest rates, through the increased exposure and interaction of and with police, as improvements in perceptions of safety. As congestion pricing is expected to further increase ridership, the slippage between public order and public safety raises concerns over class and race inequities in controlling, accessing, and creating public space. <br> <br>
The incongruence between crime data and militarization call into question policy responses (what/who is being securitized or criminalized and why) and the role of mass media in manufacturing consent (Herman and Chomsky, 1988) and representing the public. <br> <br>
  The argument here is not to determine whether the public believes the subway system is safe. It has mixed reviews, really. Rather, we present a narrative of safety that is governed by data, policy, media, and notions of public. <br> <br>
</p>

<h4>A Trip Through Time</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
Our study is grounded in the reported Subway happenings between January 2022 and April 2025, a time period that avoids the bulk of COVID chaos and coincides neatly with the start of Eric Adams' tenure. In so doing, we provide a survey of events in a manner that begins to blend epistemologies of public order. It is futile to speak about causality in the web that is public policy formation, journalism, and social media, but even an unearthing of (dis)agreements are an effective way of probing the sculpting of public opinion and mechanisms of state power. <br> <br>
  
The interactive window below pulls from various multimedia to paint a temporal trajectory of policing in the Subway system and public perceptions of safety. As you scroll down, the column on the left cycles through every New York Times headline since 2022 covering the Subway. Headlines that are more alarmist are highlighted in orange. For more detailed methodological information and an infographic summary, see the "Media Mania" section further on. The column on the right contains synopses of key events juxtaposed with related footage from citizen videos and institutional journalism. The sources of these short clips are listed in the references section, and are not limited to the New York Times. <br>

<h4>Media Mania</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
The media and law enforcement are chicken and egg, but figuring out their sequence is perhaps less important than realizing they are a combined snowball. They reference one another perpetually, creating a feedback loop that is both key in disseminating information publicly, but also prone to excluding said public in the processes of publishing and policy creation. <br> <br>
  
  In this study, the New York Times is used as a proxy for institutional media writ large. The authors acknowledge the limitations of this choice. In a wider endeavor, the perspectives of other journalistic outlets would be considered. Here, the Times is chosen because of its ubiquitous and purported neutral stance (whether or not this is valid is debatable). <br> <br>

In order to systematically create an overview of Subway sentiment, every archived local or regional New York Times article published between January 2022 and April 2025 is scanned via the <a href = "https://developer.nytimes.com/apis"> NYT API </a>, and the following key metadata are saved to a table: timestamp of publication, headline, abstract, and banner image URL. From this collection, articles whose headline or abstract contain the word “Subway”, “MTA”, or “transit”, are saved as a subset. Then, headlines from this subset are manually combed through and tagged if they seem to stoke a sentiment of fear. This designation comes from an admittedly subjective heuristic of emotional response. Generally though, if a violent act or other mention of public safety is present in a headline, it is marked. <br> <br>

A time series collapsed bar chart below visualizes this media data, and select callouts earmark some of the more sensationalized stories of the last few years. It is perhaps no surprise that the isolated and horrific acts of violence have more sustained news cycles and eye-catching headlines. The widest blocks of orange in the companion visualization tend to follow such stories. In contrast, sparser media coverage follows policy announcements around increased police in the transit system, the deployment of the National Guard, and even the Sep 15th, 2024 incident where police opened fire at a Brooklyn station, gravely injuring an uninvolved bystander. Many orange streaks following this latter incident are unrelated to it; rather, they are court appearance rehashings of the May 1st, 2023 murder of Jordan Neely. <br> 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
In the case of Jordan Neely, his murderer Daniel Penny was acquitted of all charges and widely celebrated by factions of the right for his self-claimed neutralizing of a public threat (Schnitzer & Pelletier, 2024). The truth is that Jordan Neely was the exact victim of systemic discard that rendered him vulnerable to public hatred (Chan, 2023). While “mentally ill people are more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than to commit one” (Harris et al., 2023), the rhetoric has fully re-embraced broken windows theory. For instance, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez has said “quality-of-life issues, when left unaddressed, can erode public confidence and fuel a sense of disorder,” (NYC.gov, 2025), and it is exactly that word, disorder, that seems to be the media’s master key into facilitating the paradox of simultaneous increases in police presence and alleged decreases in violent incidents according to the NYPD. <br> <br>

The Dec 22nd, 2024 immolation of Debrina Kawam was in a sense the culmination of manufactured public sentiment that had been festering since the worst of COVID lifted. Some painted her as the face of the unhoused and parroted the sentiment that people using the Subway system for shelter should be forcibly removed. Others used the Guatemalan perpetrator as an excuse for a larger diatribe against Latin American migrant populations. <br> <br>

In both Neely and Kawam’s cases, it is clear that the media capitalized on the magnitude of the event, stoking slippery and unproductive public discourse, and doing nothing to foster a forum of dialogue around modern policing and its dearth of compassionate methods. <br> <br>
</p>

<h4>Big Data Policing</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
The NYPD has increasingly used urban informatics to justify their decisions, especially around ballooning budgets and hiring (Vera Institute, n.d.). These statistics often take the form of grand and nebulous self-congratulations, depicting a decrease in serious index crimes over some chosen month year over year (Kuntzman, 2025). While terms like "crime", "arrests", and "disorder" are often used in these reports, they are not clearly defined. As a result, they move from being numerical instruments to metonymic sleights of hand - for instance, "disorder" might be construed to signal the unhoused or migrant populations (Chronopoulos, 2017). The catch-22 of urban policing is bulldozed by the following rationale: we see a decrease in crime as we define it, we attribute this to police work, therefore, we hire more police as an extra measure. As with the cycle of broken windows policing in the late 20th century, a lack of experimental control renders these associations potentially spurious (Chronopoulos, 2017). To prod at some of the less visible data infrastructure underpinning the mainstream narrative, some spatial analysis follows. <br> <br>

  Arrests are taken to be a proxy for police activity in this study, because other ancillary citizen information is either out of date or unavailable. This is a systemic limitation. Arrest data spanning 2022 through 2024 are downloaded from the NYPD’s data portal as well as the City of New York’s historical arrest records. These are stitched together in ascending order and filtered to the subset of arrests where the jurisdiction code is 1.0, signifying transit. These transit records are then categorized into quality-of-life (comprising violations and misdemeanors) and felony arrests.  <br> <br>
  
Dividing the arrest count by the MTA’s averaged daily ridership volume between 2022 and 2024 normalizes patterns across the city. This aggregation is performed at the community district level to strike a balance between data point counts and granularity. After further roll-ups to month-level precision, we generate a time series choropleth of both quality-of-life and felony arrests across our 36-month study window.
Visible in the below video, the number of quality-of-life arrests broadly increases across community districts over time. This is most pronounced in areas like East Brooklyn or the South Bronx, which are already sites of perpetual disinvestment (Susaneck, 2024). They are also geographically far from the high-traffic stations of Manhattan Hochul so keenly deployed the National Guard to (Allen, 2024). The left two still maps in the frame are provided for visual context around the demographic nature of the areas of New York City that see the highest rates of transit over-policing. Data is presented on a generic low to high spectrum - the left two maps use Jenks natural breaks, while the third uses normalized quantiles across its temporal range, so as to fairly assess the 2-year evolution. <br> <br>

</video>
<p></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
According to the data, quality-of-life arrests went up 77% from 2022 (4864) to 2023 (8617) and 96% from 2023 to 2024 (16929) respectively, citywide. At the same time, felony arrests went up 29% from 2022 (1834) to 2023 (2374) and 22% 2023 to 2024 (2887). Given Subway ridership has been between 1 and 1.2 billion yearly since 2022, the relatively accelerated progression in policing statistics is notable. In addition, it is bizarre that the official crime statistics offered by the MTA deviate from tabulations of the raw NYPD records. Looking only at felonies between 2023 and 2024, their summary claims a decrease from 2337 to 2211 (NYPD, 2025), while this study tallies an increase from 2374 to 2887. <br> <br>

In a recent statement from Hochul celebrating the one year anniversary of her "Safer Subways" initiatives, she boasts that major transit crimes are down 29% while arrests are up 71% year to date and that major transit crimes are down 28% compared to the same period in 2019 (Governor Kathy Hochul, 2025). This period is not defined, the supposed correlation between crime reduction and arrest increase is taken for granted, and the nature of said arrests is left open - given the magnitude of the statistic, it almost certainly includes quality-of-life arrests. <br> <br>

Again, because the MTA’s summary statistics do not offer a definition of “crime”, these incongruences are likely not methodically resolvable. They do add to a concerning trend of data cherry-picking by the NYPD in their high-level reporting (Baker, 2017 and Dyson et al., 2024).  <br> <br>
</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
Safety, like security, is about collective management (Ghertner et al., 2020). Safety is abstract, aspirational, and contested. Under broken windows theory, it locates and anticipates a target (that which we should fear, categorize as threat, risk, danger, criminal, out of place) and defines the infrastructure of safety through calculable risk (police presence, barriers, fare gates, surveillance). The resurgence of broken windows theory staged on the notion of public safety is a display of political theatre that steers sentiments of safety in the Subway. <br> <br>
