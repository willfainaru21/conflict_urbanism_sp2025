title:  "Incomplete Democracy: Mapping Protest as New Indicators of Political Sentiment"
author: "Wooseok Jang, Yeonjin Kim"

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: sans-serif;">
In modern democratic societies, the political opinions of citizens are primarily expressed through public opinion polls and media. However, in recent times in Korea, the trust in these traditional indicators has sharply declined. During President Yoon Suk-yeol’s impeachment crisis, the Myeongtaegyun Gate revealed that politically manipulated public opinion polls were being disseminated through the media, and the fact that extreme and false information created on social media platforms—including YouTube—is influencing politics has greatly shocked Korean citizens.<br><br>
Against this backdrop, citizens took to the streets to express their political views directly and physically. This project aims to analyze the protest data from these citizens and visualize it on urban spaces, thereby proposing a new map of democracy that can complement the existing distorted public opinion polls and media.</p>

<p>This project aims to collect data on the scale and frequency of protests and to visualize it within the urban landscape as a new indicator for expressing political opinions. Since protests are physical and direct acts of participation—making data manipulation difficult—they can serve as a more reliable political indicator compared to the distorted opinion polls and media saturated with false information. Ultimately, this project seeks to build a map of democracy that is directly created by the citizens on the streets.</p>

<p>This project represents an effort to map true democratic sentiments not through the distorted or untrustworthy public opinion polls and media coverage, but through direct political actions, namely protests by citizens. It critically visualizes the complexity and incompleteness of modern Korean democracy by embracing, rather than avoiding, the inconsistencies and limitations of imperfect data and materials.<br><br>
Ultimately, the project aims to create an undistorted “map of democracy on the streets” through data generated by the citizens.</p>
